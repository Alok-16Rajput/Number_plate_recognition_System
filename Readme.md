# Number Plate Recognition System üöó

## üìå Overview

#### This project is a Number Plate Recognition System that utilizes OpenCV, Keras, and TensorFlow to detect, extract, and recognize vehicle license plates. The system first detects the number plate using Haar Cascade Classifier, processes the plate image, and then classifies individual characters using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## üõ† Technologies Used
#### >Python
#### >OpenCV (for image processing and plate detection)
#### >Keras & TensorFlow (for building and training the CNN model)
#### >NumPy & Pandas (for data handling)
#### >Matplotlib (for visualization)
#### >scikit-learn (for model evaluation)

## üìä Dataset
#### The dataset used for training the Number Plate Recognition System consists of individual character images.

### 1 Character Dataset:
#### >Contains individual characters (A-Z, 0-9) extracted from number plates.
#### >Each character is stored as a grayscale image of size 28x28 pixels.
#### >Used for training the CNN model to recognize letters and digits.

## üîÑ Workflow
### 1.Load Image & Preprocess

#### >Read the image using OpenCV.
#### >Convert it to grayscale.
#### >Apply Haar Cascade to detect the number plate.
#### >Crop and preprocess the detected plate.

## 2.Character Segmentation

#### >Apply thresholding, erosion, and dilation to clean the image.
#### >Find contours of characters.
#### >Extract individual character images.

## 3.Character Recognition

#### >Resize characters to 28x28.
#### >Feed them into a trained CNN model.
#### >Predict and decode the characters into a readable format.

## 4.Model Training

#### >Uses categorical cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer.
#### >Trained using ImageDataGenerator for data augmentation.

## 5.Evaluation & Performance Metrics

#### >Evaluate accuracy using a validation dataset.
#### >Display confusion matrix and classification report.

## üöÄ How to Run

### 1.Clone the repository:
#### Step 1: Clone the repository
#### git clone https://github.com/Shubham-Singla259/Number-Plate-Recognition-System.git

### Step 2: Navigate into the project directory
#### cd Number-Plate-Recognition-System


## 2.Install dependencies:
#### pip install -r requirements.txt

## 3.Run the code:
#### python Number_plate_recognition.ipynb

## üìà Result
#### >Achieved high accuracy using CNN model.
#### >Successfully detects and recognizes Indian number plates.
#### >Robust against different lighting conditions and angles.

#### The model achieved 75% accuracy because i am using a small dataset therefore accuracy is minimum but it can be improved if perform it on a large dataset. Future improvements could include training with a larger dataset, improving character segmentation, and fine-tuning the model architecture for better generalization.

## üèÜ Future Improvements
#### Improve OCR accuracy using advanced deep learning models.
#### Add real-time detection using live camera feed.
#### Support for multiple languages and number plate formats.
## üèÜ Future Uses and Applications
### 1.Real-time Traffic Management

#### Implementing the system with live traffic cameras to automatically capture and analyze vehicles, helping authorities monitor traffic flow, issue tickets, or identify stolen vehicles in real-time.

### 2.Parking Lot Management

#### Using the system in parking lots to track vehicle entries and exits, automatically record the time a vehicle enters or exits, calculate parking fees, or detect unauthorized vehicles.

### 3.Toll Collection Systems
#### Automating toll collection by recognizing vehicles passing through toll booths, enabling automatic fee deduction from registered accounts.
