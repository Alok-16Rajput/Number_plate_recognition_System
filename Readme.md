# Number Plate Recognition System üöó
---
## üìå Overview
---
 This project presents an automated Number Plate Recognition (NPR) system leveraging OpenCV, Keras, and TensorFlow to accurately detect, extract, and recognize vehicle license plates. The system employs a Haar Cascade Classifier for initial plate detection, followed by image preprocessing and segmentation. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is then utilized to classify and recognize individual alphanumeric characters on the plate.

## üõ† Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **OpenCV (for image processing and plate detection)**
- **Keras & TensorFlow (for building and training the CNN model)**
- **NumPy & Pandas (for data handling)**
- **Matplotlib (for visualization)**
- **scikit-learn (for model evaluation)**

## üìä Dataset
The dataset used to train the Number Plate Recognition System comprises individual character images extracted from license plates, enabling accurate classification of alphanumeric characters.

## 1 Character Dataset:
- **Consists of individual alphanumeric characters (A‚ÄìZ, 0‚Äì9) extracted from vehicle license plates.**
- **Each character is represented as a 28√ó28 pixel grayscale image.**
- **Primarily used to train the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for accurate recognition of letters and digits.**
